 AWS Lambda Backend Setup----

This is a React Native application that utilizes AWS Lambda for serverless backend functionality. The application allows users to perform [mention what your application does, e.g., image text extraction] using AWS Textract.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the React Native application and deploy the AWS Lambda function.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following in place:

Node.js and npm installed
React Native development environment set up
An AWS account with access to AWS Lambda and Textract services
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

shell
Copy code
npm install
[Mention any additional setup steps, such as configuring AWS credentials.]

Running the React Native Application
To run the React Native application on your device or emulator, use the following command:

shell
Copy code
npx react-native run-android  # for Android
# OR
npx react-native run-ios      # for iOS
[Add any additional information or specific steps required to run your app.]

AWS Lambda Backend
The AWS Lambda backend handles the serverless functions for your application. Below is the AWS Lambda function code responsible for [describe what the Lambda function does, e.g., text extraction from images]:

javascript
Copy code
import { TextractClient, AnalyzeDocumentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-textract";
import { fromBase64 } from "@aws-sdk/util-base64-node";

const client = new TextractClient({ region: "ap-south-1" });

function extractTextFromResponse(response) {
    let extractedText = "";

    if (response && response.Blocks) {
        response.Blocks.forEach(block => {
            if (block.BlockType === "LINE" && block.Text) {
                extractedText += block.Text + "\n";
            }
        });
    }

    return extractedText.trim(); // Remove leading/trailing whitespace
 }   

export const handler = async (event, context) => {
    try {
        const decodedData = Buffer.from(event.body, "base64").toString();
  const command = new AnalyzeDocumentCommand({Document: {Bytes: Buffer.from(decodedData, "base64")},
        FeatureTypes: ["TABLES", "FORMS"]});
        
        const response = await client.send(command);
        const extractedText = extractTextFromResponse(response);

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({data: extractedText})
        }
            
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log("er"+error)
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Internal server error, Error processing file'})
        };
    }
};
